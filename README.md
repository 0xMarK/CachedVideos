# CachedVideos

A solution to cache videos while playing with AVPlayer.

By default all video-files are cached into `<AppDirectory>/tmp/Videos`. The path can be changed by editing the `VideoManager.videosDirectory` variable.

By default all video-files names generated by stripping the `/` from `url.path`. That can be changed in `VideoManager.localFileURL(from:)`.
